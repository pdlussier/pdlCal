<div><b>Buttons and drop-down menu at the top of the page:</b></div>
<ul>
<li><b>Preview Theme</b>: When pressed, the theme displayed in this window will be temporary activated for the calendar and a Stop Preview button will be displayed. The calendar can now be browsed with these styles, until the Stop Preview button is selected.</li>
<li><b>Save Theme</b>: The displayed theme will be saved to the database and from now on this theme will be used by the calendar. The previous theme in the database will be overwritten.

<li><b>Backup Theme</b>: The theme from the database will be stored in a file in the css folder. The name given to the file will be shown in the information line at the top of the window. The file extension will be "mbak".</li>
<li><b>Restore Theme</b>: This drop-down menu will show the LuxCal default theme and all backup files (".abak" and ".mbak") in the css folder. When an entry is selected the theme from the selected file will be displayed in the Styling page. This theme can then be previewed, modified and saved.</li>
<li><b>Close Window</b>: Close the Styling window. If there are unsaved changes, a warning will be displayed.</li>
