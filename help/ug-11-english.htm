<h6>Help for Gantt Chart view</h6>
<br>
<div>In this view you will see a graphical presentation of all events in sequential order for the selected period. On the left-hand side you will see the event titles followed by the event start date and the event duration in days, hours and minutes. Events that have no duration (no end time), show a diamond symbol (â—†) in the duration column. In the right part of the chart the events with a duration are represented by a bar with a length proportional to its duration. The bar is shown in the color of the event category and is followed by the event title. Hovering an event bar will show the details for that event. For repeating or multi-day events the hover box border will be red; for normal events the hover box border will be grey.</div>
<div>Multi-day events will be shown by means of a single long bar and repeating events will be shown by a bar per event occurrence.
