<h6>Help for Matrix view (users)</h6>

<div>In this view you will see a matrix with all registered calendar users on the left hand side, each user followed by the events created by that user in the following date period.

For repeating or multi-day events the hover box border will be red; for normal events the hover box border will be grey.</div>
