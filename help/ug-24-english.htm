<h6>User Guide for the Thumbnail Images Page</h6>
<br>
<div>This page is used to use, upload and delete thumbnail images. Thumbnail images are saved per user, so you can have your own thumbnails and there can be thumbnails of other calendar users. You can use thumbnails in the event's description fields by inserting it's filename in the description text. An image file name can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the desired thumbnail on the Thumbnails Images page; subsequently, in the Event window, the image name can be inserted in one of the fields by typing CTRL-V.</div>
<div>Whether you can manage (deleted and upload) your own thumbnails and whether you can use and delete other users thumbnails, depends on the rights the administrator has given to your user group.</div>
